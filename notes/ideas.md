## Loops as basis elements
The problem amounts to a choice to include or not every basis vector.
If loops are not adjacent -> decoupling and reduction of complexity.
Is there any hope of finding decoupled loops in large graphs?
Or maybe b-reduction breaks one of these loops?

## Rank of problem with m factors if all variables have degree 2
> rk = m - C

with C the number of connected components. (Euler's formula)
But this works **only for planar graphs**!

### To do:
- Observe the effect of adding leaves or not (at fixed rate) when using
    - Exact solution on small systems
    - Simulated annealing with MCMC on basis coefficients
    
### Would be nice:
- Somehow use loops in the graph to build a basis with small (maximum) Hamming weight

### Done:
- Discard graphs with multi-edges

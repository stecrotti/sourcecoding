## Loops as basis elements
The problem amounts to a choice to include or not every basis vector.
If loops are not adjacent -> decoupling and reduction of complexity.
Is there any hope of finding decoupled loops in large graphs?
Or maybe b-reduction breaks one of these loops?

A pool of loops is a connected component in the dual graph. 
The size of pools can be checked by computing the sizes of such connected components.
If the size grows subextensively....


## Rank of problem if all variables have degree less or equal to 2
> rk = #factors + #leaves - #CC

(Euler's formula).

But this works **only for planar graphs!** Is ours?
